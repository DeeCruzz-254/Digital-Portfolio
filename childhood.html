        <p>The Foundation of My Technical Journey</p>

        <h2>Formative Logic</h2>
        <p>My journey began with an analytical mindset, often found dissecting family financial patterns and the mechanics of early home computers. These formative moments shaped a personality built on precision, risk assessment, and technical curiosity.</p>
        
        <h3>Early Influences</h3>
        <p>Growing up in Nairobi, I was exposed to the digital revolution at an early age. While my peers played games, I was curious about how systems worked. I took apart old computers, rewired circuits, and questioned every technological limitation I encountered.</p>
        
        <h3>Building Block Moments</h3>
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>First Programs</h3>
            <p>My first lines of code were written in Python at age 12. Simple scripts that automated mundane tasks sparked a passion that hasn't faded since.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Math & Logic</h3>
            <p>Mathematics became my playground. Algorithms, cryptography, and computational theory fascinated me more than any video game ever could.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Entrepreneurial Spirit</h3>
            <p>By age 16, I had launched my first tech project - a simple web platform for local businesses. It taught me about real-world constraints and the importance of user-centric design.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Journey Continues</h3>
        <p>These childhood experiences weren't just hobbies—they were the substrate upon which my professional identity is built. Every system I architect, every line of code I write, and every security vulnerability I hunt stems from that early curiosity and desire to understand how things work.</p>
